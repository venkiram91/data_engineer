Model

Step 1: Plot the histogram for the given set of density for POI (Count values for POI)

Step 2 :Understanding the skewness in the data

			If Median=Mean = normal distibuted
			If Median < Mean = Left Skewed
			If Median > Mean = Right Skewed 
			
The skeweness also indicates the presence and effect of outliers on the given density

Step 3 :Find confidence interval (density value) for the values of 90%,80%,70%,60%,50%,40%,30%,20%,15,10%

Step 4: 

   Case 1: For normal distribution find the critical values using area under curve around mean
   
   Case 2 : For skewed distribution find the critical values using 
				1) t-value based confidence interval if the data set size is large
				2) Wilcoxon signed-rank which concentrates around median
				3) Bootstrap method
   
Step 5: Apply hash map function to map the POI to specific buckets leabelled from -10 to 10 as below

	h(-10) = x < mean and x ≤ lower bound critical value for 90%
	h(-9)  = x < mean and x > lower bound critical value for 90% and x ≤ lower bound critial value for 80%
	h(-8)  = x < mean and x > lower bound critical value for 80% and x ≤ lower bound critial value for 70%
	h(-7)  = x < mean and x > lower bound critical value for 70% and x ≤ lower bound critial value for 60%
	h(-6)  = x < mean and x > lower bound critical value for 60% and x ≤ lower bound critial value for 50%
	h(-5)  = x < mean and x > lower bound critical value for 50% and x ≤ lower bound critial value for 40%
	h(-4)  = x < mean and x > lower bound critical value for 40% and x ≤ lower bound critial value for 30%
	h(-3)  = x < mean and x > lower bound critical value for 30% and x ≤ lower bound critial value for 20%
	h(-2)  = x < mean and x > lower bound critical value for 20% and x ≤ lower bound critial value for 15%
	h(-1)  = x < mean and x > lower bound critical value for 15% and x ≤ lower bound critial value for 10%
	h(0)  = x ≤ mean and x > lower bound critical value for 10% 
	h(1)  = x > mean and x ≤ upper bound critical value for 10% 
	h(2)  = x > mean and x > upper bound critical value for 10% and x ≤ upper bound critial value for 20%
	h(3)  = x > mean and x > upper bound critical value for 20% and x ≤ upper bound critial value for 30%
	h(4)  = x > mean and x > upper bound critical value for 30% and x ≤ upper bound critial value for 40%
	h(5)  = x > mean and x > upper bound critical value for 40% and x ≤ upper bound critial value for 50%
	h(6)  = x > mean and x > upper bound critical value for 50% and x ≤ upper bound critial value for 60%
	h(7)  = x > mean and x > upper bound critical value for 60% and x ≤ upper bound critial value for 70%
	h(8)  = x > mean and x > upper bound critical value for 70% and x ≤ upper bound critial value for 80%
	h(9)  = x > mean and x > upper bound critical value for 80% and x ≤ upper bound critial value for 90%
	h(10) = x > mean and x > upper bound critical value for 90%
	
The POI assigned with label 10 naturally belong to the higher density and density decreases as we proceed the labels to -10

Bonus:

Case 1: Understanding how POI density determines the success of a advertisement promotion

Null Hypotheses: The POI density does not influences the reach of advertisement promotion

Assumptions:

1) Assuming no other factors influence the promotion (say th product is newly launched )
2) Assuming the desnity of the POI remains relatively constant

Testing
1) Select two POI of verying density and launch the same adertisement promtoion
2) Collect the sales data of the product and check the variability of the data through t-test
3) Repeat the test for similar samples

Conclusion:
If the variation is significant enough then the null hypotheses is rejected reflecting the fact that POI density infuences
the success of a promotion

Case 2: Understanding advertisement success from POI density

Null Hypotheses: The advertisement does not influences the density of POI

Assumptions:

1)The POI density remains relatively constant
2)The POI under consideration has no other influence (say new market)

Testing:
1) Select two POI of relatively same density prior to advertisement
2) Launch the advertisement in one test set and keep the other parameters constant at both the test test
3)The A/B testing would give the idea on the effect of advertisement on the POI
4)Repeat the experiment on similar sample

Conclusion:
If the variation is significant enough,then the null hypotheses is rejected
